/**
 * Sync Refund Status from Razorpay to Airtable
 * 
 * This script:
 * 1. Fetches payments from Razorpay that have refunds
 * 2. Matches them with Airtable records
 * 3. Updates the refund status in Airtable
 */

// Note: This script would need to be run with proper environment setup
// For now, I'll create the logic structure

console.log('Starting refund status sync...');

// The actual implementation would:
// 1. Fetch all payments from Razorpay (already done above)
// 2. Filter payments with refund_status: "full" or "partial"
// 3. For each refunded payment, search Airtable for matching record
// 4. Update Airtable Payment Status to "Refunded"

// Since we're using MCP tools directly, let me process this step by step
